==============================================================================

The set of TCStools scripts is basically a dump of my internal scripts used
to test the GEANT Trusted Certificate Service. This is the Generation 4
instance (2020 edition) of the service, with associated scripts. The scripts
will be different for each generation, and even within a generation may
vary over time.

Some have found these scripts useful, e.g. for cleaning out historic roots 
that are included by Sectigo into the generated certificate chains in SCM.
See the README.txt file for what each script does.

Apologies for the commit logs and many typos in the commit messages. This
repo was previously a private subversion repo for myself only, and the
exact commit messages did not matter much. Oh well ... now I'm bitten by it.

The public versions of these scripts are at
  https://software.nikhef.nl/experimental/tcstools/

and some are included in the DutchGrid TCS pages at
  https://ca.dutchgrid.nl/tcs/

Enjoy!
